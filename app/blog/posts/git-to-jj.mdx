summary: 'Why I switched from Git to JJ'
---

I know, I know - another blog post about Git and JJ? Really? But hear me out. I have been talking to a lot
of software engineers about version control lately (as all jj transitioners do), and I don't think many actually
think about that topic. 

Be honest: how well do you know Git? I mean really know it. Do you know from the top of your head how to squash
the fiths last commit into the sixths? Do you know how to rename second last commit? 

## Why even bother?
