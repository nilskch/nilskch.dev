Welcome to yet another blog! I love talking to my collegues about the latest tech, controversial 
opinions in software engineering, and what cool hobby project they worked on over the weekend.

I enjoy sharing my thoughts and ideas with the world (sometimes too much), and I love hearing and reading
about other people's opinions and experiences. I strongly believe that sharing knowledge in written form 
is a crucial skill for any software engineer. Being able to explain complex concepts in a simple way is 
a superpower! Working async on open source, writing an RFC for your collegues, or creating excellent 
documentation for your project are is important as writing good code. Moreover, I believe there is a strong
correlation between writing and thinking. Becoming a better writer makes you a better thinker, and being a better
thinker makes you a better software engineer. I think expressing your thoughts precisely in free text form is very
similar to expressing your thoughts precisely in code.

I need to improve in all of these areas, and the best way to do that is to practice. I will write
about my hobby projects, my controversial opionions, and anything else that comes to my mind!
