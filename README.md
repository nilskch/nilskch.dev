# Nils' Corner of the Web ðŸš€

> [!NOTE]
> This README was vibe coded with AI because Zed just released the agentic mode and I am enjoying it a bit too much. Also didn't check the content of the produced README. ðŸ˜Ž

Welcome to my personal blog! This is where I share my coding adventures, thoughts, and occasional bursts of inspiration.

## What's this all about?

This is a Next.js-powered blog where I write about things I find interesting. Coding is my passion, and this site is both a playground for me to experiment with web technologies and a place to document my journey.

## Tech Stack

This site is built with:
- Next.js (latest canary)
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4.0 (alpha)
- MDX for content

## Running Locally

If you want to run this locally (not sure why you would, but hey, I won't judge):

```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nilskch.dev.git

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

Then head over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the magic happen.

## Why Does This Exist?

Because coding is fun, sharing knowledge is cool, and I needed somewhere to put all those random thoughts that keep me up at night. Plus, it's a great excuse to play with new tech!

## License

This project is licensed under the terms that you can find in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file. Basically, be cool.
